**BUG Severity & Priority**

#
# Severity

The degree of impact a defect has on the development or operation of a component or system. 

The defect severity can have different classifications based on the project, organization, tracking tool, etc. 

There’s a scale of how threatening a bug is for the system. It ranges from level 1 (most damaging) to level 5 (least damaging)

## Level 1. Loss of data

Bugs could cause loss of user (end-user, operator, etc.) or system data.

## Level 2. Loss of functionality

Bugs could block the use of a major functional area. 

*Can include nonfunctional problems (e.g., performance) that impose delays in functionality.*

## Level 3. Loss of functionality with a workaround

Bugs could block the use of a major functional area, but a reasonable affected-user workaround exists.

## Level 4. Partial loss of functionality

Bugs could block some unessential portion of a functional area.

## Level 5. Cosmetic error

Bugs could allow normal functionality but with significant blemishes (especially in UI or system responsiveness).
Priority levels

#
# Priority

The importance of fixing bugs is based primarily on the ability of the system to meet customer needs.

*We could also include logistical project issues, regulatory or standards compliance, or other business considerations.*

The priority scale ranges from 1 (most important to fix) to 5 (least important to fix).

## Level 1. Urgent

Bugs require immediate resolution.

## Level 2. Essential

Bugs are a must-fix for release.

## Level 3. Valuable

Bugs could significantly reduce the value of the system to one or more customers or users.

## Level 4. Desirable

Bugs could be fixed in this release within feature, budget, and schedule constraints (if possible); otherwise, in the next scheduled release.

## Level 5. Discretionary

Bugs can be resolved whenever possible in some future release, allowing for other priorities.
